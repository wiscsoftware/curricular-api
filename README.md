# Design and Implementation of a REST API for Curricular data in Higher Education

The design and implementation of a REST API for student and course data for a Higher Education institution.This shows 
how to start with users' needs (user stories) and use that to design
the API specification, and finally the implementation. This API design focus on some of the key resources such as
`/students`, `/teachers`, `/classes`
and can be extended to include other resources such as `/universities` (if the institution consists of multiple
universities such as [Universities of Wisconsin](https://www.wisconsin.edu/), that
has [13 universities](https://www.wisconsin.edu/campuses/) or [University of California](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/) 
that consist of [10 campuses](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/campuses-locations)), `/enrollments`, `/schools`, `/courses` etc..

Feel free to reach us at contact@baranasoftware.com to see how we can collaborate in your API design and implementation
effort.

## Tech Stack 

Technologies used in the implementation. `Go` language was used considering its support for building low cost and maintainable
Cloud Native apps in AWS. `SQLite` was used because this is a high transaction system (500K requests/second) 
with mostly read-only data (write-once a day and read-many times a day). Note that the implementation here uses a mock 
datastore([store.go](src/api/store.go))

## System Design

[Design of a REST API for Curricular data](https://github.com/baranasoftware/system-design/blob/main/edu-api.md)

## Running Locally
```
go run main.go  --local=true --port=8080
Curricular API server listing on port: 8080
```

Registering a client. Returns `clientId` and `secret` for subsequent requests:
```
$ curl -X GET localhost:8000/register
{"clientId":"db72caf4-5002-4c54-967e-55dba9a2704e","secret":"hztUn9rROthCb8gmdtt4gshSlgdaXTuN"}
```
    
Authorize the client:
```
$ curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/authorize?client_id=db72caf4-5002-4c54-967e-55dba9a2704e&response_type=code'

```

Get the token:
```
$ curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=db72caf4-5002-4c54-967e-55dba9a2704e&client_secret=hztUn9rROthCb8gmdtt4gshSlgdaXTuN&scope=read'
{"access_token":"ZJU3NDNMOWUTOGE3YY0ZNTM5LWFJNZYTZDFJNTDMYJQWZJM0","expires_in":7200,"scope":"read","token_type":"Bearer"}
```

Access the resource `/students`:
```
$ curl -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer ZJU3NDNMOWUTOGE3YY0ZNTM5LWFJNZYTZDFJNTDMYJQWZJM0' localhost:8000/students

## AWS Resources 
AWS resources were created with [Terraform](./terraform) [using](./Makefile):
```
cd src; GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -tags lambda.norpc -o bootstrap main.go; \
cd ../terraform; \
AWS_PROFILE=<aws-profile> AWS_REGION=us-east-1 terraform init  -var aws_account_ids=[aws-account-ids] -var sec_group=<security-group-id>;\
AWS_PROFILE=<aws-profile> AWS_REGION=us-east-1 terraform plan  -var aws_account_ids=[aws-account-ids] -var sec_group=<security-group-id>;\
AWS_PROFILE=<aws-profile> AWS_REGION=us-east-1 terraform apply -var aws_account_ids=[aws-account-ids] -var sec_group=<security-group-id>;
```

## Invoking API from APIGateway
```
curl -X GET -H 'X-API-Key: <API-Key>' https://<api-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/curricular-and-academic-api/students/
